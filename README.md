### Audify: Dynamic Voice Editing System

Audify is a versatile platform designed to simplify audio editing by allowing users to correct specific errors in voice recordings without the need to delete the entire file. The project supports the Egyptian Arabic dialect, with plans to expand to other dialects and languages.

It relies on two key models:
- **Google Speech-to-Text API**: For accurate audio transcription.
- **XTTS-v2**: For text-to-speech conversion with voice cloning, preserving the user's unique voice, pitch, and dialect.

The process includes:
1. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Transcribes audio, including Egyptian Arabic, into editable text.
2. **Text Editing**: Allows users to correct transcription errors.
3. **Voice and Pitch Cloning**: Converts the edited text back into audio while maintaining the user's original voice.

Audify is designed for general use by individuals, studios, companies, or professional entities, ensuring broad accessibility and usability. The coding for the project will be uploaded in the future, but the web app will be available for now.
